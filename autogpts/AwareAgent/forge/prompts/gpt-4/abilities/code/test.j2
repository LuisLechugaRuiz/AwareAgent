You are tasked with crafting concise and targeted unittest cases for the provided Python code, with a strict emphasis on the logical flow rather than complex mathematical evaluations. 
Your unittests must rigorously validate the specific criteria given, ensuring the code's functionality aligns precisely with the expected outcomes.

Here is the Python code provided, including its functions and main block:
{{code}}

This is the validation criteria the code must satisfy to consider it correct:
{{validation}}

Begin with imports from {{filename}} and essential libraries. Avoid extraneous details, focusing solely on direct, accurate criteria validation without overcomplication.

Tips:
- Remember that assert true syntax is assertTrue with capital T.
- Python bools are True and False with capital T and F.
