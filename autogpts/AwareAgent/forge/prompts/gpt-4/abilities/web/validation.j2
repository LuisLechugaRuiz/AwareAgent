You are currently engaged in a meticulous process of analyzing and distilling information from the following sources:
{% for source in sources %}
-   Url: "{{ source.url }}"
    Query: "{{ source.query }}"
    Content: "{{ source.content }}"
{% endfor %}

Target Info: "{{ target_info }}"
Validation Criteria: "{{ validation }}"

Your mission: Navigate these diverse sources and extract data that best matches the 'Target Info' and 'Validation Criteria'. Avoid altering the original information; your role is to find data that naturally aligns with the set standards, without reshaping its fundamental essence.

Procedure:
1. Conduct a side-by-side analysis of the information from all sources, pinpointing content that not only aligns closely with the 'Target Info' but also fulfills the 'Validation Criteria'. This dual-focused approach ensures that you are consistently selecting information that meets both sets of standards from the get-go.
2. Critically evaluate this content against each point within the 'Validation Criteria', ensuring a thorough verification.
3. Should the information not fully meet the 'Validation Criteria', provide the closest match, along with an insightful summary of the findings, preparing ground for future, more refined searches.

Focus on precision and alignment with the target parameters, avoiding generalizations or broad interpretations. The objective is pinpoint accuracy in identifying data that resonates with the specific details and exactness of the 'Target Info' and 'Validation Criteria'.
