Analyze the following sources, using queries as hints to pinpoint specific information. 
Ensure extracted data meets the 'Validation Criteria'.

{% for source in sources %}
-   Url: "{{ source.url }}"
    Query: "{{ source.query }}"
    Content: "{{ source.content }}"
{% endfor %}

Validation Criteria: "{{ validation }}"

Seek information that naturally aligns with the validation criteria without altering or reinterpreting data. 
Your response should prioritize precision and match the criteria's exactness.

Compare the sources, extracting relevant data. Verify if the data aligns with each validation criteria. 
If 'criteria_met' is False, provide a synthesis of the findings to guide future attempts.
