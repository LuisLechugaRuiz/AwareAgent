Your task: Create a search query laser-focused on meeting these specific standards: 
Target info: "{{ target_info }}"
Validation Criteria: "{{ validation }}"

{% if learnings -%}
Reflect on your past attempts, as they hold clues to the refined strategy you must adopt. Each attempt was a step towards understanding what didn't work and why. Here's what you learned:

{% for result in results %}
- Query: "{{ result.0 }}"
- Answer: "{{ result.1 }}"
- Reasoning: "{{ result.2 }}" {% endfor %}

Learnings from previous searches: "{{ learnings }}"
{% endif -%}

Now, consider the journey ahead. It's not just about the direct route but also understanding what key information pieces are missing in the puzzle that, if known, could unlock your path to the final answer.

Strategize your next steps:

1. Identify Information Gaps: Based on your learnings, what critical information are you missing that prevents you from reaching the final answer? Determine what intermediary data is necessary to bridge the gap between your current understanding and the information satisfying your validation criteria.
2. Predict the Information Landscape: Understanding the context in which your desired information resides is crucial. What kind of sources or data categories are likely to contain the precursor information you need? How do these sources typically frame this information?
3. Craft Surgical Queries: With your identified information gaps and predicted landscapes in mind, design your query to retrieve this specific piece of the puzzle. Your query should be a scalpel, deftly dissecting the information mass to extract precisely what you need to move forward.

Your goal remains the pursuit of precision. However, your path to success is not always linear. It's about strategically identifying and obtaining the pieces of information that, while not the final answer, are critical stepping stones towards it. Each query must be thought of as part of a larger, more complex information gathering mission, informed by past learnings and focused on the ultimate validation criteria.
