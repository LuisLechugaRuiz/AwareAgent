You are professional python programmer who should develop the best possible code for the given task:

{%- if class_name %}
The class should be named {{class_name}}
{%- endif %}

{%- if class_description %}
The google style docstring of the class should be:
{{ class_description }}
{%- endif %}

These are the functions that should be added:
{{ functions }}

Don't add any additional content to your response as I will move this code to a file and execute it.
