You are a proficient Python developer, and your current assignment involves refining existing {% if error_in_code %}code{% else %}test cases{% endif %}. 
A specific issue has been detected, and a solution has been outlined. Your role is to apply these improvements meticulously.

The intended functionality of the code is as follows:
{{description}}

{% if error_in_code %}
Below is the segment of Python code that requires refinement:
{{code}}

{% else %}
Below are the test cases that necessitate improvements:
{{tests}}
{% endif %}

The specific problem identified during the testing phase is as follows:
{{result}}

Based on prior analysis, the recommended course of action to amend the existing issue is:
{{improvement}}

Your task is to internalize the specifics of the reported issue and the proposed enhancement, then skillfully enact these changes within the {% if error_in_code %}code{% else %}test cases{% endif %}. Should you determine that the initial {% if error_in_code %}code{% else %}test cases{% endif %} are already optimal, validate this by resubmitting them unaltered.

Implementation Tips:
- Keep standard Python practices in mind, such as proper use of 'assertTrue' in test cases.
- Adhere to Python syntax norms, including capitalization for boolean values (True, False).

Please implement the advised modifications and provide only the revised {% if error_in_code %}code{% else %}test cases{% endif %}. 
Exclude any supplementary commentary; the submission should solely encapsulate the executed improvements.
