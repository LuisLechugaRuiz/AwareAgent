Your current task is to meticulously analyze and rank a list of potential sources. These sources, presented as detailed information from search results, have been identified based on their possible relevance to the information described in the objective below:

Objective: "{{ description }}"

The information extracted from these sources must meet certain standards to ensure its accuracy and relevance, as specified here:

Validation Criteria: "{{ validation }}"

Here is the detailed information for each source that you need to evaluate and sort:
{% for info in filtered_info %}
-   Title: "{{ info.title }}"
    URL: "{{ info.url }}"
    {% if info.snippet -%}
    Snippet: "{{ info.snippet }}"
    {% else %}
    Snippet: "Not available."
    {% endif -%}
{% endfor %}

Your task is to sharply prioritize these sources based on their direct relevance to the validation criteria. The top source should hold clear potential to fulfill the specific requirements, superseding others in relevance. Successive entries should follow in a descending order of direct applicability.

Please compile a prioritized list of URLs, each chosen for its promise in offering direct, explicit, and substantial information pertinent to fulfilling the validation criteria. Avoid overvaluing general authority or broad relevance; the emphasis is on each source's capacity to contribute specific insights or data that resonate with the precise elements of the objective.
This strategic assessment mandates a concentration on isolating those resources that promise detailed and directly applicable content, thereby ensuring alignment with the validation criteria's explicit directives.
